      "description": "### What is Ozon Seller API\n\nOzon Seller API is a software interface for working with the Ozon marketplace and exchanging information between the seller's system and Ozon.\n\nSeller API methods allow you to change store data, such as product stocks and prices, and retrieve data, such as information about returns or a list of warehouses.\n\nWorking with the API consists of sending a request and receiving a response. To do this, you can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), the **Console** tab above the method description, or set up integration with accounting systems, such as 1C, ERP or MoySklad.\n\n### When the Seller API is useful\n\nOnce you integrate the seller's accounting system with the Seller API, you can update and receive data automatically. This helps to keep prices and stocks information up-to-date, process more orders in less time, and eliminate errors caused by manual data updates.\n\nFor example, you need to update stocks or prices information for 100 products. To do this using your personal account,\nyou need to manually change the data on each product card.\n\nHowever, you can update stock information for 100 products with one request using the [/v2/products/stocks](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductsStocksV2) method, and the [/v1/product/import/prices](#operation/ProductAPI_ImportProductsPrices) method allows you to update their prices.\n\n### What you can do using Seller API features\n\n- Upload and update products.\n- Manage prices and product stocks.\n- Get information about product returns.\n- Manage FBO, FBS and rFBS orders.\n- Manage chats.\n- Work with invoices.\n- Receive financial and analytical information.\n- Download Ozon attributes and characteristics.\n"

Get the list of categories and types in a tree view and use the value from the last level of the selected category: [/v1/description-category/tree](#operation/DescriptionCategoryAPI_GetTree).\n\n2. Get characteristics for the selected category and type: [/v1/description-category/attribute](#operation/DescriptionCategoryAPI_GetAttributes).\n\n3. Get a list of values for the selected characteristic: [/v1/description-category/attribute/values](#operation/DescriptionCategoryAPI_GetAttributeValues).\n\n# Uploading and updating products\n\nAfter comparing your attributes and characteristics with the Ozon attribute model, you can start uploading products:\n\n1. Upload products and services: [/v3/product/import](#operation/ProductAPI_ImportProductsV3). This method also\n   allows you to update already uploaded products. The request sets the primary price and uploads product images.\n   You can send up to 100 products in one request. Images should be uploaded as direct links to the cloud storage, where they are stored.\n\n   The method output is a `task_id`, the product upload task identifier.\n\n2. Check the `task_id` that you received while uploading products: [/v1/product/import/info](#operation/ProductAPI_GetImportProductsInfo). The method will return information whether the products were uploaded successfully or there was an error during import.\n\n    If the response contains the `moderating` status, wait for the moderation results and check the product status again. Moderation usually takes less than one day.\n\n3. Get a list of products created after uploading products: [/v3/product/list](#operation/ProductAPI_GetProductList).\n\n   The method allows you to use filters to divide products into groups by visibility status or track their status changes\n   using the product identifier.\n\n   The method returns a pair of `offer_id` and `product_id` values. They are needed in almost all queries for identifying the product with which the action will be performed. If you have uploaded products via template, use this method to\n   get the `offer_id` and `product_id` in order to work with products via API in the future.\n\n## Uploading and updating product images\n\nTo add product images or replace existing ones, use:\n\n1. [/v1/product/pictures/import](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductImportPictures): upload or update product images. Pass direct links to images uploaded to the cloud storage.\n2. [/v2/product/pictures/info](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductInfoPicturesV2): check the uploading status.\n\n## Updating products\n\nTo update both product information and its characteristics, use the [/v3/product/import](#operation/ProductAPI_ImportProductsV3) method.\n\nIf you only need to update the product characteristics, use the [/v1/product/attributes/update](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductUpdateAttributes) method.\n\n## Getting products information\n\n- Get product details, for example barcode, main offer price, category identifier, commission, or moderation errors: \n  [/v3/product/info/list](#operation/ProductAPI_GetProductInfoList). Use filters from the [/v3/product/list](#operation/ProductAPI_GetProductList) method to get a list for all products \n  in bulk or by category.\n\n- Get a product characteristics description: [/v4/product/info/attributes](#operation/ProductAPI_GetProductAttributesV4).\n  This method allows you to add extra information about the product to make the product card more complete.\n\n- Get a product description that can be used for creating a similar product: [/v1/product/info/description](#operation/ProductAPI_GetProductInfoDescription).\n\n- Get information about the markdown and the main product by the markdown product SKU: [/v1/product/info/discounted](#operation/ProductAPI_GetProductInfoDiscounted).\n\n## Deleting or archiving products\n\n1. Delete a product if it was uploaded with an error and got into the archive without an SKU: [/v2/products/delete](#operation/ProductAPI_DeleteProducts). \n   Products that have successfully passed moderation and received an SKU cannot be deleted from the archive.\n\n2. Move a product into the archive: [/v1/product/archive](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductArchive). Reset the product stocks to zero before archiving it.\n\n3. Get a product back from the archive: [/v1/product/unarchive](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductUnarchive).\n\nThe product will go on sale only when you set its stocks.\n\n## Services management\n\nUpload activation codes for services and digital products: [/v1/product/upload_digital_codes](#operation/ProductAPI_UploadDigitalCode).\n\n# Uploading quality certificates\n\n## Information about certificates\n\n- Get a certificate types list: [/v1/product/certificate/types](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductCertificateTypes).\n- Get the list of categories subject to certification: [/v2/product/certification/list](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductCertificationList).\n- Get a certificate statuses list: [/v1/product/certificate/status/list](#operation/CertificateStatusList).\n- Get a accordance types list: [/v2/product/certificate/accordance-types/list](#operation/CertificateAccordanceTypes).\n- Get a list of certificate rejection reasons: [v1/product/certificate/rejection_reasons/list](#operation/RejectionReasonsList).\n- Get your certificates: [v1/product/certificate/list](#operation/CertificateList), using filters:\n   - certificate type `type`—value `value` from the [/v1/product/certificate/types](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductCertificateTypes) method response;\n   - certificate status `status`—value `code` from the [v1/product/certificate/status/list](#operation/CertificateStatusList) method response.\n\n## Working with products associated with a certificate\n\nFor binding a certificate to a product:\n1. Get a list of brands that require a certificate: [/v1/brand/company-certification/list](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductCertificateBind).\n   The response contains brands whose products are added in your seller account.\n   The brands list may change if Ozon receives a requirement from the brand to provide a certificate.\n2. Add a product certificate: [/v1/product/certificate/create](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductCertificateCreate).\n3. Bind a certificate to a product: [/v1/product/certificate/bind](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductCertificateBind).\n\nTo get a list of products associated with a certificate, use the [v1/product/certificate/products/list](#operation/CertificateProductsList) method.\nIf you need to get a list of products with a certain status, in the `status` parameter, pass the `code` value from the [v1/product/certificate/product_status/list](#operation/ProductStatusList) method response.\n\nTo unbind a product from a certificate, use the [/v1/product/certificate/products/unbind](#operation/CertificateUnbind) method.\n\n## Certificate status management\n\nTo get the attributes for managing a certificate:\n1. Get a certificate types list: [/v1/product/certificate/types](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductCertificateTypes).\n2. Get a accordance types list: [/v2/product/certificate/accordance-types/list](#operation/CertificateAccordanceTypes).\n\nTo create a certificate, use the [/v1/product/certificate/create](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductCertificateCreate) method, by passing in the request:\n- certificate type `type_code`—value `value` from the [/v1/product/certificate/types](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductCertificateTypes) method response;\n- accordance type `accordance_type_code`—value `code` from the [/v2/product/certificate/accordance-types/list](#operation/CertificateAccordanceTypes) method response.\n\nTo delete a certificate, use the [/v1/product/certificate/delete](#operation/CertificateDelete) method.\n\n# Updating prices and product stocks\n\nAfter uploading the products for the FBS and rFBS schemes you can proceed to updating the stocks. For the FBO scheme, the stocks are updated\nautomatically once the product is sold.\n\nTo update the stocks, use the [/v2/products/stocks](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductsStocksV2) method. \nWhen using this method, specify the identifier of the warehouse for which you want to change the stocks.\n\nTo get information on the stock quantity for FBO, use the [/v4/product/info/stocks](#operation/ProductAPI_GetProductInfoStocks) method.\n\nTo get information on the stock quantity for FBS and rFBS, use the [v1/product/info/stocks-by-warehouse/fbs](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductStocksByWarehouseFbs) method.\n\nTo update prices by products without making changes to the product cards, use the [/v1/product/import/prices](#operation/ProductAPI_ImportProductsPrices) method.\n\nThe method allows you to update the price:\n\n- before discounts,\n- for customers with an Ozon Premium subscription,\n- on the product card, taking discounts into account,\n- minimum product price with all promotions applied.\n\n<aside class=\"warning\">\nThe product price can become lower than the minimum price if you apply different types of promotions to the same product.\n</aside>\n\nTo get information on product prices, commissions, and discounts, use the [/v5/product/info/prices](#operation/ProductAPI_GetProductInfoPrices) method.\n\n## Reserve products\n\nIf legal entities order products, payment may not arrive immediately. Such products are automatically reserved.\nTo check the stock, use [/v3/posting/fbs/get](#operation/PostingAPI_GetFbsPostingV3), [/v3/posting/fbs/list](#operation/PostingAPI_GetFbsPostingListV3), or [/v3/posting/fbs/unfulfilled/list](#operation/PostingAPI_GetFbsPostingUnfulfilledList) methods.\nIf `is_legal = true` is in the response, there are reserved products in the stock.\nYou can update the stock so that the new number of products is greater than the available stock and reserved products in total.\nThe system will deduct the old stock and calculate the new one.\n\nTo check if a product is reserved, use the [/v1/product/info/stocks-by-warehouse/fbs](#operation/ProductAPI_ProductStocksByWarehouseFbs) or [/v4/product/info/stocks](#operation/ProductAPI_GetProductInfoStocks) methods.\n\n[Learn more about stock management](https://docs.ozon.ru/global/en/fulfillment/stock/)\n\n# Participate in promotions\n\nTo promote products, participate in promotions that Ozon runs for customers:\n\n- Get a list of available promotions: [/v1/actions](#operation/Promos).\n\n- Get a list of products that can participate in a promotion: [/v1/actions/candidates](#operation/PromosCandidates).\n\n- Add products to a promotion: [/v1/actions/products/activate](#operation/PromosProductsActivate).\n\n- Get a list of eligible products: [/v1/actions/products](#operation/PromosProducts).\n\n- Remove products from a promotion: [/v1/actions/products/deactivate](#operation/PromosProductsDeactivate).\n\nCustomers can ask you for a discount on a product.\nTo get a list of products that customers want to buy at a discount, use the method\n[/v1/actions/discounts-task/list](#operation/promos_task_list).\nRequests in statuses `NEW` or `SEEN` you can:\n- approve—use the [/v1/actions/discounts-task/approve](#operation/promos_task_approve) method,\n- decline—use the [/v1/actions/discounts-task/decline](#operation/promos_task_decline) method.\n\n[Learn more about promotions in Help Center](https://global.ozon.ru/en/docs/promotion/promo.html).\n\n# Setting pricing strategies\n\nPricing strategies is a tool for automatic change of product price according to the prices of similar products in other online stores and marketplaces.\n\nTo set pricing strategies:\n\n1. Get a list of competitors: [/v1/pricing-strategy/competitors/list](#operation/pricing_competitors).\n\n2. Get a list of pricing strategies: [/v1/pricing-strategy/list](#operation/pricing_list).\n\n3. Create your own strategy: [/v1/pricing-strategy/create](#operation/pricing_create) and set coefficients to increase or decrease product price compared to other online stores and marketplaces.\n   To get information about a strategy, use the [/v1/pricing-strategy/info](#operation/pricing_info) method.\n\n4. Bind products to a strategy: [/v1/pricing-strategy/products/add](#operation/pricing_items-add).\n\n   You can bind products:\n   - If you set a minimum price for them via [/v1/product/import/prices](#operation/ProductAPI_ImportProductsPrices) method.\n     To check the price, use the [/v5/product/info/prices](#operation/ProductAPI_GetProductInfoPrices) method.\n   - If they aren't bounded to another strategy.\n     To check product binding, use the [/v1/pricing-strategy/strategy-ids-by-product-ids](#operation/pricing_ids) method.\n\n   Use the [/v1/pricing-strategy/products/list](#operation/pricing_items-list) method to get a list of products that are bounded to the strategy, and the [/v1/pricing-strategy/products/delete](#operation/pricing_items-delete) method to remove products from the strategy.\n\n7. Enable or disable the strategy: [/v1/pricing-strategy/status](#operation/pricing_status).\n\nTo change a list of selected competitors and a strategy name, use the [/v1/pricing-strategy/update](#operation/pricing_update) method.\n\nTo delete a strategy, use the [/v1/pricing-strategy/delete](#operation/pricing_delete) method.\n\n# Getting warehouses details\n\n- Get a warehouse methods list: [/v1/delivery-method/list](#operation/WarehouseAPI_DeliveryMethodList).\n\n- Get a warehouse list: [/v1/warehouse/list](#operation/WarehouseAPI_WarehouseList).\n\n# Working with FBS warehouses\n\n## Create new warehouse\n\n1.

Partner warehouses don't accept products without barcodes.\n</aside>\n\nThis method allows you to create products and update their details.\n\nYou can add or update a certain number of products per day. To find out the limit, use\n[/v4/product/info/limit](#operation/ProductAPI_GetUploadQuota). If the number of product creations\nand updates exceeds the limit, an `item_limit_exceeded` error will appear.\n\nYou can pass up to 100 products in one request.\nEach product is a separate element in the `items` array. Make sure to specify all the product details: its characteristics, barcode, images, dimensions, price, and currency code of the price.\n\nWhen updating a product, pass all information about the product in the request.\n\nThe specified currency must be the same as the one set in the personal account settings. By default, the passed currency is `RUB` — Russian ruble.\nFor example, if your currency set in the settings is yuan, pass the value `CNY`, otherwise an error will be returned.\n\nThe product won't be created or updated if you fill in incorrectly or don't specify the following information:\n   - **Mandatory characteristics**: The characteristics depend on category. You can view them in [Help Center](https://docs.ozon.ru/global/en/products/requirements/required-characteristics/#required-characteristics) or via [/v1/description-category/attribute](#operation/DescriptionCategoryAPI_GetAttributes) method.\n   - **Real volume and weight characteristics**: `depth`, `width`, `height`, `dimension_unit`, `weight`, `weight_unit`. Don't skip these parameters in the request and don't specify 0.\n\nYou can use HTML tags for some characteristics.\n\nOnce the moderation is complete, the product will appear in your personal account, but won't be available to customers until you put it up for sale.\n\nEach product in the request is a separate element of the `items` array.\n\nTo merge two product description pages, pass `9048` in the `attributes` array for each product. All attributes except size or color must match in these description pages.\n\n## Uploading images\n\nTo upload images, pass in the request the links to the images in the public cloud storage. The image format is JPG or PNG.\n\nArrange the pictures in the `images` array as you want to see them on the site. Use the `primary_image` parameter to set the main image.\nIf the `primary_image` parameter is not specified, the first picture in the array will be the main one for the product.\n\nYou can upload up to 30 pictures for each product. If you use the `primary_image` parameter, the maximum number of pictures in the `images` parameter is 29.\nIf the `primary_image` parameter is not specified, you can upload up to 30 pictures to the `images` parameter.\n\nTo upload 360 images, use the `images360` field, and to upload a marketing color, use `color_image`.\n\nIf you want to add, remove, or replace some images, or change their order, first get the details using the [/v3/product/info/list](#operation/ProductAPI_GetProductInfoList) method.\nUsing it you can get the current list of images and their order. Copy the data from the `images`, `images360`, and `color_image` fields and make the necessary changes to it.\n\n## Uploading videos\n\nTo upload video, pass the links to the videos in the request.\n\nPass an object to the `complex_attributes` array. To `attributes` list of the object pass 2 objects with `complex_id = 100001`:\n\n- In the first object set `id = 21841` and pass object with video link to the `values` list.\n\n  __Example__:\n\n  ```\n  {\n    \"complex_id\": 100001,\n    \"id\": 21841,\n    \"values\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwM0iBn03dY\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n\n- In the second object set `id = 21837` and pass object with video name to the `values` list.\n\n  __Example__:\n  \n  ```\n  {\n    \"complex_id\": 100001,\n    \"id\": 21837,\n    \"values\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"videoName_1\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n\nIf you want to upload several videos, pass the values for each video in a different object of the `values` array.\n\n  __Example__:\n\n  ```\n  {\n    \"complex_id\": 100001,\n    \"id\": 21837,\n    \"values\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"videoName_1\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"videoName_2\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"complex_id\": 100001,\n    \"id\": 21841,\n    \"values\": [\n      {\n        \"value\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwM0iBn03dY\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"value\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\"\n      }\n    ]\n  } \n  ```\n\n## Uploading size chart\n\nIf you've created a size chart using our [constructor](https://table-constructor.ozon.ru/visual-editor), you can add it to the PDP as rich content `id = 13164`. Pass it in the `attributes` array in JSON format.<br><br>\n[Constructor in JSON format](https://table-constructor.ozon.ru/schema.json)<br>\n[Learn more about the constructor in the Help Center](https://docs.ozon.ru/global/en/products/requirements/size-table-constructor/)\n\n## Uploading video covers\n\nYou can upload a video cover using `complex_attributes`.\n\n__Example__:\n\n```\n\"complex_attributes\": [\n  {\n    \"attributes\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": 21845,\n        \"complex_id\": 100002,\n        \"values\": [\n          {\n          \"dictionary_value_id\": 0,\n          \"value\": \"https://v.ozone.ru/vod/video-10/01GFATWQVCDE7G5B721421P1231Q7/asset_1.mp4\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n",
